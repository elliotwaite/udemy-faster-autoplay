# Udemy Faster Autoplay

When watching a Udemy course with the autoplay setting enabled, once a video
ends, you are advanced to the next video after a 3-second delay. This extension
removes that 3-second delay so that you are advanced to the next video
immediately.

Note: This extension respects the Udemy video player's "Autoplay" setting. So
if you disable autoplay, this extension will do nothing.
