# Udemy&trade; Faster Autoplay - Browser Extension

If you enable autoplay while watching a Udemy playlist, once a video ends, you
are usually advanced to the next video after a 3-second delay. This extension
removes that 3-second delay so that you are advanced to the next video
immediately.

If you disable autoplay in the Udemy video player settings, this extension will
do nothing.

This browser extension is currently being reviewed, but I will add links to
where you can download the Chrome Extension and the Firefox Add-on once they
have been approved.
